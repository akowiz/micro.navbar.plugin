# Navigation Bar (navbar) Plugin #

The wc plugin provides the user with the ability to navigate through a
file using the classes or functions that have been defined within the
file. This is extremely usefull for very long files.

Each programming language defines its own structures to define class and
functions. Support for a proramming language is not automatic.

Currently, the languages supported are:

- Python2
- Python3
- Lua

To toggle the side window with the navigation bar, simply press "F5" (or use command `navbar`).


In the navbar side windows, you can navigate using your keyboard or the mouse.

Press '+' to open a closed node (or use command `nvb_open`).
Press 'o' to open all closed nodes (or use command `nvb_open_all`).
Press '-' to close an open node (or use command `nvb_close`).
Press 'c' to close all open nodes (or use command `nvb_close_all`).
Press ' ' to jump to the corresponding symbol in the main window (or use command `nvb_goto`).
